This emulator is based on what I made for the 1013D to allow getting better insight in
the code while developing new firmware for it based on the work done for the 1013D.

It needs a modified binary of the scope firmware to disable the SD card, because that part
is not emulated.

The speed is not optimal, but for tracing the code it is sufficient.
