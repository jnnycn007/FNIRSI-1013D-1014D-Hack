A simulator for the FNIRSI 1014D scope.

This simulator needs some of the FNIRSI-1014D scope source files to make it work on the PC.
It is intended for the development of that scope software on the PC, to make it easier to do
the testing and the debugging.

Since the new open source firmware is still in development the repository for it is private
and will be set public when a first version is good enough for testing.
